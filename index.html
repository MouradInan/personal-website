      <p id="intro">Highly curious person, I display an exceptional ability to learn new methods and to think along constructive original lines.
      On the other hand, I am always ready to participate in extra-professional activities. I am a light amateur of Japan and animes.
      I am very interesting about data science research and mathematics. Finally, I have some crypto-currencies in my wallet. </p>
